# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: Dual-CPU IPC pipes

This example demonstrates how to use the inter-processor communication (IPC) driver to implement a message pipe in PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. The pipe is used to send messages between CPUs.

See the "PSoC&trade; 6 MCU dual-CPU development" section in [AN215656](https://www.cypress.com/AN215656) – *PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: Dual-CPU system design* for instructions on how to develop dual-CPU applications.

## Overview

In this example, the CM0+ CPU generates 32-bit random numbers periodically using the crypto block. The CM4 CPU receives the random numbers from the CM0+ CPU through IPC pipes. The CM4 CPU prints the random numbers to a terminal emulator. It also controls when the CM0+ CPU starts and stops creating random numbers.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "\<CE title>" is displayed on the UART terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application name> debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **quick panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

In this code example, the CM4 CPU is the primary CPU, which is responsible to initialize the system. To avoid any access to uninitialized hardware, CM0+ waits for CM4 to complete the system initialization by waiting for an IPC command. This code example handles four types of IPC commands:

- `IPC_CMD_INIT`: CM0+ waits for this command to initialize
- `IPC_CMD_START`: CM0+ waits for this command to enable a watchdog timer and the Crypto block
- `IPC_CMD_STOP`: CM0+ waits for this command to disable a watchdog timer and the Crypto block
- `IPC_CMD_STATUS`: CM4 waits for this command to print a number to the terminal

The CM0+ CPU uses a watchdog timer to periodically wake itself up from sleep. Once it wakes up, it generates a 32-bit random number using the crypto block and sends it to the CM4 CPU.

The CM4 CPU checks if the user has pressed the kit button. When a button press is detected, CM4 informs CM0+ to start creating random numbers. When the button is released, CM4 instructs CM0+ to stop creating random numbers. When CM4 receives a message from CM0+, it parses it, and prints the random number to the terminal.

   **Figure 2. Firmware flowchart**

   ![](images/flowchart.png)


### Folder structure

This application has a different folder structure because it contains the firmware for CM4 and CM0+ applications as shown below:

    |-- app_cm0p/           # CM0+ application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/           # All dependencies folder for CM0+
    |-- app_cm4/            # CM4 application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/           # All dependencies folder for CM4
    |-- shared/             # Shared folder for CM0+ and CM4
        |-- include/        # Shared header files
        |-- source          # Shared source files
        |-- linker_script/  # Contains linker scripts for the ARM/GCC_ARM/IAR toolchains
        |-- COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/  # Contains design configuration files shared between the CM0+ and CM4.
                                            # These files are replicated from the default BSP configuration.
                                            # This code example does not require any custom configuration.
                                            # The intent is to show how to share design configuration between the CM0+ and CM4.

When using the default BSP settings provided by the *TARGET* folder, it allocates only 8192 bytes of RAM and flash for the CM0+ CPU. This example requires more memory for CM0+; therefore, a custom linker script is required, which is located at *shared/linker_script*.


### IPC communication

This code example uses a user pipe. The shared folder contains the implementation of a custom initialization of the system pipes, system semaphores, and user pipes. Each CPU has its own initialization function. Note that the Makefile of both CPUs adds `CY_IPC_DEFAULT_CFG_DISABLE=1` in the `DEFINES` variable. This disables the default IPC configuration that comes with the BSP.
